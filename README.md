## Flight Travel Frequency Survey

I chose to explore the question: *“How often do you travel by plane?”* because I'm curious about how common air travel is among different groups of people. With the rise of remote work and global connectivity, I wanted to see whether frequent flying is still the norm or if it's becoming less common.

What I found interesting was the wide range of travel habits. Some people fly multiple times a month for business or family reasons, while others may only take a flight once every few years. More surprisingly, there are a great number of people answered Never for air travel frequency.
The chart below helps visualize these patterns clearly:
